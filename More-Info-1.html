      <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2"> PXC IOT, in its core, is one big, automatically routed, IPv4/6 network. Running our zerotouch client creates a virtual dynamic network interface (pnet0) with an unique&nbsp; address and associate routes. through our controller base network, you can introduce routes and rules as you would with any other ip device, the main difference is the IOT network is virtual and dynamic, encapsulated, but if you choose to leave it enabled, we've developed an extensive rules based system system for you. You can have multiple virtual islands/networks, your devices can access multiple networks or you can even share access to those networks with other users!<br>
        <br>Key features:<br>
        <br>Low Latency - Peer-to-Peer connection between devices. After establishing a connection, PXC Infrastructure (Pxc Base Controller Servers) are used only as a mesh failover proxy if P2P connection is not possible.<br>
        <br>Zero Configuration - Automated installation of our light Client, you can add new devices to your network from email/dashboard through our Yang process.<br>
        <br>Low Reconfiguration Time - in case of a network topology change (eg. transition between two Wi-Fi hotspots), PXC will manage handover in real time with no downtime; other competitors usually need 1 - 3 seconds to reestablish a new or handover Peer-to-Peer connection.<br>
        <br>Lightweight - ~&lt;20kb it works not only on popular OSes but even on RToS e.g. ESP32 microcontrollers. That means you can P2P access your things without an IoT server ! and as a bonus reduce liabilities on 4g/5g interfaces.<br>
        <br>Secure &amp; Private - packets never leave connected devices unencrypted, Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFC) enabled by default and is fully embedded in devices and our peering exchange.
